## 1. Background & Objectives  

CoinPaprika‚Äôs API and datasets power thousands of retail dashboards, bots, and research tools, but **awareness and evergreen backlinks** lag behind larger aggregators.  
Traditional hackathons are expensive (USD¬†10‚Äì50‚ÄØk), logistically heavy, and often result in a short‚Äëlived spike of attention.  
We need a lightweight, **monthly ‚Äúbacklink engine‚Äù** that:  

* Generates 40‚Äì60 new public GitHub repositories every second month.  
* Embeds a mandatory badge linking to our landing page, compounding SEO authority.  
* On‚Äëboards fresh developers to our API with minimal friction.  
* Avoids the accounting nightmare of multiple micro‚Äëcrypto payouts.  

---

## 2. Executive Summary  

"**Paprika Vibe‚ÄëCode**" is a recurring, four‚Äëweek coding jam (not a full hackathon).  
Participants publish **‚â§‚ÄØ50‚Äëline utilities** that combine:  

* CoinPaprika REST API.  
* MCP server.  
* SDKs or endpoints from a **token‚Äëpartner project** or us.  

Every entry lives in its own GitHub repo tagged `paprika-vibe‚ÄëMMYY`, ensuring an automatic gallery page and a backlink.  

**Prizes (10 winners / edition)** are digital:  

| Item | Source | Cash cost to CoinPaprika | Value to winner |
|------|--------|--------------------------|-----------------|
| Partner‚Äëproject tokens (10 √ó USD 100) | Partner treasury (we pay the USD 1,000 invoice and they distribute tokens) | USD 1,000 |
| 10 √ó 6-month **CP Pro** subscription | Internal | USD 11,940 |
| Claude token credits (GPT‚Äë4o‚ÄëHaiku) | Anthropic promo | USD 500 |
| Feature on CP socials & blog | Internal | Brand exposure |
| Prize from partner | Partner Treasury | - |

**Key Benefits of Partner Reliance:**
* **Accounting Simplicity:** Partners handle all token distributions, eliminating micro-crypto payment complexity
* **Enhanced Social Media Reach:** Joint announcements and cross-promotion amplify our message across partner communities
* **Reduced Operational Overhead:** Single partner coordination vs. managing multiple individual payouts

## 8. GitHub Engagement & Anti-Bot Strategy  

### Why GitHub Engagement is Safe & Effective

**Forking is GitHub's First-Class Workflow:**
- GitHub explicitly encourages forking for collaboration, tutorials, and hackathons
- Major companies (Microsoft, Supabase, Vercel) run "fork-and-go" events with thousands of forks
- GitHub's own Octoverse Challenges use stars as community metrics‚Äîno bans reported

**Spam Detection Focus:**
- GitHub looks for automation/bot traffic, not popularity
- Real humans clicking "Fork" via UI are always safe
- Sudden star/fork spikes are only rate-limited if they come from scripted traffic

### Anti-Bot Guard-Rails

| Guard-Rail | Implementation | Benefit |
|------------|----------------|---------|
| **Account Age Filter** | Ignore repos from accounts < 30 days old or < 3 public repos | Removes bulk of throw-away bot accounts |
| **One Repo Per Handle** | Require Submission Issue with repo URL; deduplicate by owner | Stops multiple forks from same user inflating numbers |
| **Require Real Commits** | Check that `pushed_at ‚â† forked_at` via GitHub API | Ensures participants actually wrote code |
| **Manual Review** | Only judge ~20 finalists‚Äîeasy to spot obvious junk | Final defense vs. copy-paste spam |
| **Bot Star Detection** | State in rules: "Detected bot-generated ‚≠ê will void Community-Love points" | Deterrence + GitHub Support backing |
| **Template Repos** | Use "Use this Template" instead of direct forks | Avoids massive fork graph while preserving backlinks |

### Technical Implementation

**Rate Limiting:**
- Webhook automation: max 100 repos/hour
- GitHub API: stay under 5k nodes/min for GraphQL queries
- Respect abuse limits to avoid triggering flags

**Monitoring Script:**
```python
# Nightly check for suspicious activity
def check_suspicious_stars():
    for repo in submissions:
        new_stars = get_stars_from_accounts_under_24h(repo)
        if new_stars > 100:
            warn_entrant(repo.owner, "Suspicious star activity detected")
```

### Best Practices Summary

1. **Use Template Repos** - "Use this Template" creates fresh repos instead of forks
2. **Document Anti-Spam Rules** - Clear guidelines in README and contest rules
3. **Open GitHub Discussion** - Pin "How to enter safely" instructions
4. **Flag Suspicious Activity Early** - Proactive monitoring and warnings
5. **Focus on Quality Over Quantity** - Innovation/usefulness outweigh raw star counts

*Bottom Line: Running a "fork-and-ship" jam is standard DevRel practice. With proper guard-rails, we're at virtually zero risk while maximizing backlink benefits.*
